# Main app
This main app provides scripts to install and run the end-to-end pipeline. This includes Speech-to-Text, Text-to-Sound, and Sound Generation services, as well as the sampler/playback tool.

## Usage and Manual
A [manual](https://github.com/TheSoundOfAIOSR/rg_production/blob/main/Manual.md) that describes the UI functionalities and how to use the app is available at https://github.com/TheSoundOfAIOSR/rg_production/blob/main/Manual.md

If you encounter any issues running or installing the app, please check if there is a [Github issue](https://github.com/TheSoundOfAIOSR/project_common/issues) already open for it or open a new issue and get in touch with us for troubleshooting tips.

## Dependencies
### Csound
* Csound https://csound.com/
* latest version should run, tested version in this project is `6.16.2`
* https://github.com/csound/csound/releases/tag/6.16.2
* install .exe 
* or unzip .zip version in a folder that is added to the system path

On MacOs, if homebrew is installed, the setup script will install Csound automatically.

### Python
* Python version 3.8 is to be used
* in case python 3.8 available on the system but not the default one then use `setup3.8.bat` instead of `setup.bat`

## Setup and Run
Each service requires its own virtual python environment which is created during the setup. 

⚠️ Only a single repo setup supported per system due to installs in global temp directory. e.g. pm windows `C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\`. As a workaround it is possible to delete the directory `C:\Users\User\AppData\Local\Temp\tfhub_modules` before running the setup.

⚠️ The install may take several minutes.
